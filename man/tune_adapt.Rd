\description{
\code{tune_adapt()} computes a set of perfomance metrics (e.g. accuracy or RMSE)
for a pre-defined set of tuning parameters that correspond to a model or
recipe across one or more resamples of the data.
}
\details{
Suppose there are \emph{m} tuning parameter combinations. \code{tune_adapt()} may not
require all \emph{m} model/recipe fits across each resample. For example:

\itemize{
\item In cases where a single model fit can be used to make predictions
for different parameter values in the grid, only one fit is used.
For example, for some boosted trees, of 100 iterations of boosting
are requested, the model object for 100 iterations can be used to
make predictions on iterations less than 100 (if all other
parameters are equal).
\item When the model is being tuned in conjunction with pre-processing
.        used. For example, if the number of PCA components in a recipe step
are being tuned over three values (along with model tuning
parameters), only three recipes are are trained. The alternative
would be to re-train the same recipe multiple times for each model
tuning parameter.
}

The \code{foreach} package is used here. To execute the resampling iterations in
parallel, register a parallel backend function. See the documentation for
\code{foreach::foreach()} for examples.

For the most part, warnings generated during training are shown as they occur
and are associated with a specific resample when \code{control(verbose = TRUE)}.
They are (usually) not aggregated until the end of processing.
}
\section{Parameter Grids}{


If no tuning grid is provided, a semi-random grid (via
\code{dials::grid_latin_hypercube()}) is created with 10 candidate parameter
combinations.
}

\section{Performance Metrics}{


If no metric set is provided, one is created:
\itemize{
\item For regression models, the root mean squared error and coefficient
of determination are computed.
\item For classification, the log-likelihood and overall accuracy are
computed.
}

Note that the metrics also determine what type of predictions are estimated
during tuning. For example, in a classification problem, of metrics are used
that are all associated with hard class predictions, the classification
probabilities are not created.

The out-of-sample estimates of these metrics are contained in a list column
called \code{.metrics}. This tibble contains a row for each metric and columns
for the value, the estimator type, and so on.

A \code{summarize()} method can be used for these objects to collapse the results
over the resampled (to obtain the final resampling estimates per tuning
parameter combination).
}

\section{Obtaining Predictions}{


When \code{control(save_preds = TRUE)}, the output tibble contains a list column
called \code{.predictions} that has the out-of-sample predictions for each
parameter combination in the grid and each fold (which can be very large).

The elements of the tibble are tibbles with columns for the tuning
parameters, the row number from the original data object (\code{.row}), the
outcome data (with the same name(s) of the original data), and any columns
created by the predictions. For example, for simple regression problems
generates a column called \code{.pred} and so on. As noted above, the prediction
columns that are returned are determined by the type of metric(s) requested.

This list column can be \code{unnested} using \code{tidyr::unnest()} or using the
convenience function \code{collect_predictions()}.
}

\section{Extracting information}{


The \code{extract} control option will result in an additional function to be
returned called \code{.extracts}. This is a list column that has tibbles
containing the results of the user's function for each tuning parameter
combination. This can enable returning each model and/or recipe object that
is created during resampling. Note that this could result in a large return
object, depending on what is returned.

Note that the function given to the \code{extract} argument is evaluated on
every model that is \emph{fit} (as opposed to every model that is \emph{evaluated}).
As noted above, in some cases, model predictions can be derived for
sub-models so that, in these cases, not every row in the tuning parameter
grid has a separate R object associated with it.
